## Business Activities:

### Cryptocate
* Investors and retail cryptocurrency traders can get overwhelmed with the sheer number of data points they need to collect. Add to this the tax complexities of the new paradigm and we have a recipe for disaster. With this comes the panic of being non-compliant with the ATO, and without, in the foreseeable future, the ability to meet their tax obligations. Cryptocate, with the use of Cointracking software, was quick to meet the challenge that these Australian investors and retail traders faced.

* Furthermore Cryptocate is a cryptocurrency specialist, which means clients don’t have to change their accountant.

* SMSF - For those Australians choosing to manage their own retirement plans Cryptocate can help them report their cryptocurrency tax so that they stay compliant within the SMSF framework.

* Business - For businesses who receive payments in cryptocurrencies as part of their income Cryptocate is able to assist in managing this process with regards to ATO reporting and compliance.

* Accountants - Cryptocate can provide consultancy and guidance to other accountants relating to Australian cryptocurrency tax laws. 

* Cryptocate's tech stack include: [^2]

## Recommendations:

* Cryptocate have kept their offerings very slick, this is reflected in their website. I couldn't add to what they are already doing.

* CoinTracking.info can improve their tax loss harvesting offering in their toolset. This would improve the customers ability to minimise the capital gains tax payable. To implement this capability CoinTracking.info would need to extend their software using the same tool stack they are already using, but just polish the required output from the information already in hand. Using the current technology stack would reduce reskilling, and implementation time.

* CoinTracking.info's website could do with a fresher look. This is reflected in the higher bounce rate shown above. One of the tools in the tech stack is PHP, I would recommend that it's time to move to a more modern tech stack possibly including Flutter for seamless code development across mobile platforms.

* Currently CoinTracking.info's competitors are doing a better job of this tax loss harvesting.
