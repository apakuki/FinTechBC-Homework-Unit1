Cryptocate aims 
### Cryptocate
* Investors and retail cryptocurrency traders can get overwhelmed with the sheer number of data points they need to collect. Add to this the tax complexities of the new paradigm. With this comes the panic of being non-compliant with the ATO, and without, in the foreseeable future, the ability to meet their tax obligations. Cryptocate, with the use of Cointracking software, was quick to meet the challenge that these Australian investors and retail traders faced.

* Furthermore Cryptocate is a cryptocurrency specialist, which means clients don’t have to change their accountant.

* SMSF - For those Australians choosing to manage their own retirement plans Cryptocate can help them report their cryptocurrency tax so they stay compliant with the SMSF framework.

* Business - For businesses who receive payments in cryptocurrencies as part of their income Cryptocate is able to assist in managing this process with regards to ATO compliance.

* Accountants - Cryptocate can provide consultancy and guidance to other accountants relating to Australian cryptocurrency tax laws.

CoinTracking has accumulated over 1 million users. Its worldwide professional network consists of more than 160 tax advisors and tax lawyers to assist with international tax filing, as well as 1250 corporate clients such as crypto trading companies, fund managers and tax firms.

What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?)
