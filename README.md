* Business
If your business has received cryptocurrency as part of its income, make sure that you are compliant with accurate and comprehensive cryptocurrency business income reporting by Cryptocate.

* Accountants
Cryptocurrency exploded in popularity in 2017 in an unprecedented bull run, motivating a wide range of investors, traders and businesses to join the emerging industry. 

 

The ATO announced a data matching scheme alongside Australian domiciled exchanges, which gives the ATO access to trading data of accounts on those exchanges.

 

Declaring your cryptocurrency activity is a legal requirement when submitting EOFY tax reporting, but complexities remain due to the burgeoning nature of the asset class.




* Who is the company's intended customer?  Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers?
What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?)

* Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them? (This may take a little bit of sleuthing–– you may want to search the company’s engineering blog or use sites like Stackshare to find this information.)


## Landscape:

* Cryptocate is one of many companies entering this fast moving space and are heavily involved with the burgeoning weight of bringing crypto enthusiasts and businesses alike into tax compliance in Australia.

* With massive increase in the onboarding of new retail and business clients into the world of cryptocurrencies being able to collate trading and transactional data across many different exchanges and wallets has been a herculean task to say the least. Having tools that can access exchanges through APIs is a major step foward.

* With potential customers for tax compliance companies being scattered across vast distances using online tools for consultation is key
